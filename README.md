kodiremote-3ds is a simple (N)3DS remote control for Kodi (formerly known as XBMC)
it use the WebSocket port to control Kodi (port 9090 is the default port)

It is at the moment very trivial and with a basic GUI, but i am working on it!

it depends on json-c jpeglib citro2d libcurl

to compile it just setup a devkitpro 3ds build system and rum make (it should compile!)

Have a nice day!
